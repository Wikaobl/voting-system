## Description

I've used a combination of **CSS, JavaScript, and HTML** to create an intuitive and interactive voting platform. . Users can easily participate by entering the relevant data (_username and ID consisting of 8 numbers_) and casting a vote (_3 options to choose from_) by clicking the "_vote_" button. At the bottom, we can monitor the result of the votes in the dedicated section.

To prevent multiple votes from the same user, the website alerts them with a message saying, '_You have already voted. Thank you_' if they attempt to vote again.

When an identifier is not correct, _hints_ appear (e.g., it is invalid or too short).
