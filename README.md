## Description

I've used a combination of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create an intuitive and interactive voting platform. . Users can easily participate by entering the relevant data (username and ID consisting of 8 numbers) and casting a vote (3 options to choose from) by clicking the "vote" button. At the bottom, we can monitor the result of the votes in the dedicated section.
